# Mecha-Hand

![Mecha-Hand Picture](/image.jpg)

Hand is somehow static, by that I mean it has to stay on the table.
It is possible to rotate this hand by using android-app connected by bluetooth module.

Mecha-Hand is based on Arduino and bluetooth component.

Ratotion works on all ways: left, right, up and down.

We can to rotate with all servos connected to the hand. We need to choose which one we want to rotate.

Code is written in C with Arduino libs.
